* Creation of new versions is driven off log data.

* Log data can be obtained by:

- rlog
- log following an update.

* For a log-following-an-update, we do the update, store the new file
  versions (if available), and then log the changed files.


* Keep CVS/CrapEntries in git (looks like CVS/Entries except for
  timestamps).  CVS/Entries is not in git.  CVS/Repository and CVS/Tag
  are in git.

* CVS/CrapSync is CrapEntries last synchronised with CVS/Entries.
  I.e., diff between CVS/CrapSync and CVS/Entries is what has been
  done by CVS behind our back.
